		    What are some similarities + differences between Python and Scratch?
		    <br>Python and Scratch are both similar in terms of structure and the order in which you place your code. The commands itself are slightly different. For example Python uses "for" and "while" for loop functions, while Scratch uses "repeat," "while," and "forever." Variable creation is very similar in that Python simply uses the "=" to create a variable, while Scratch has a button to create one. Another difference is that for Python, you need to type out everything, which means you need to know the order in which you put variables and strings after a command. Scratch, in contrast, does this for you.<br>

		    How did debugging feel? What did you like? What was hard for you?<br>
		    Debugging was somewhat hard for me because I found it hard to remember the structure and order that you wrote commands (like if you used the while function I didn't know if I was supposed to put a variable or string afterwards). It wasn't too hard for me other than that because I could check line by line for problems by inactivating one line of code at a time. However, this method got tedious after a while.</p>
