    <p  style="background: #ffffff">Hi! My name is Cameron Hui and I am a senior in high school.<br>
    As of right now I am in a Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at GE Digital.<br>
    Throughout this summer I will update this page often, adding more info about myself as well as the skills I've gained.<br>
    Whoever reads this, I hope you enjoy the ride!</p>

		    What are some similarities + differences between Python and Scratch?
		    <br>Python and Scratch are both similar in terms of structure and the order in which you place your code. The commands itself are slightly different. For example Python uses "for" and "while" for loop functions, while Scratch uses "repeat," "while," and "forever." Variable creation is very similar in that Python simply uses the "=" to create a variable, while Scratch has a button to create one. Another difference is that for Python, you need to type out everything, which means you need to know the order in which you put variables and strings after a command. Scratch, in contrast, does this for you.<br>
		    <br>
		    How did debugging feel? What did you like? What was hard for you?<br>
		    Debugging was somewhat hard for me because I found it hard to remember the structure and order that you wrote commands (like if you used the while function I didn't know if I was supposed to put a variable or string afterwards). It wasn't too hard for me other than that because I could check line by line for problems by inactivating one line of code at a time. However, this method got tedious after a while.</p>

		  Today we made an LED light up using resistors, jumper wires, a breadboard and the Board of Education shield. It is our first introduction to robotics using Arduino.

		   How did your idea of robotics change today? What makes you excited/nervous about the future of robotics?<br>
		  I realized today that there are more robots in the world than we think. I think sometimes we forget that robots can be something as simple as the things we use in our daily lives, such as a Roomba. I'm excited to see our usage of robotics expand and become more sophisticated, but at the same time, am worried that these developments will soon create rifts in terms of ethics and safety.<br>
		  What worked well, and what could improve with working in groups this week?<br>
		  I liked how the room was centered so that several people could work together instead of just pairs. However, some groups having 5 people while our group only had 3 meant that our workload/problem solving was somewhat hindered. I think it was also somewhat cumbersome to have to make everyone move in order to work on the robot together, since the tables created too much distance. Overall it was a more collaborative experience compared to last week, so I appreciate that.
