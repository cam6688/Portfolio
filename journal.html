	 <h2 style="text-align: center;">Journal (July 6-7)</h2>
	  <p style="background: #ffffff">
		    What are some similarities + differences between Python and Scratch?
		    <br>Python and Scratch are both similar in terms of structure and the order in which you place your code. The commands itself are slightly different. For example Python uses "for" and "while" for loop functions, while Scratch uses "repeat," "while," and "forever." Variable creation is very similar in that Python simply uses the "=" to create a variable, while Scratch has a button to create one. Another difference is that for Python, you need to type out everything, which means you need to know the order in which you put variables and strings after a command. Scratch, in contrast, does this for you.<br>
		    <br><br>
		    How did debugging feel? What did you like? What was hard for you?<br>
		    Debugging was somewhat hard for me because I found it hard to remember the structure and order that you wrote commands (like if you used the while function I didn't know if I was supposed to put a variable or string afterwards). It wasn't too hard for me other than that because I could check line by line for problems by inactivating one line of code at a time. However, this method got tedious after a while.</p>

		  Today we made an LED light up using resistors, jumper wires, a breadboard and the Board of Education shield. It is our first introduction to robotics using Arduino.
<br>
	  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Journal (July 10)</h2>
	  <p style="background: #ffffff">
		   How did your idea of robotics change today? What makes you excited/nervous about the future of robotics?<br>
		  I realized today that there are more robots in the world than we think. I think sometimes we forget that robots can be something as simple as the things we use in our daily lives, such as a Roomba. I'm excited to see our usage of robotics expand and become more sophisticated, but at the same time, am worried that these developments will soon create rifts in terms of ethics and safety.<br><br>
		  What worked well, and what could improve with working in groups this week?<br>
		  I liked how the room was centered so that several people could work together instead of just pairs. However, some groups having 5 people while our group only had 3 meant that our workload/problem solving was somewhat hindered. I think it was also somewhat cumbersome to have to make everyone move in order to work on the robot together, since the tables created too much distance. Overall it was a more collaborative experience compared to last week, so I appreciate that.

		</video><br><br>
	We made a series of flashing LED lights today. We timed it to Lady Gaga's Bad Romance. I learned how to use an array to loop different values of a variable, making the lights and the timings flow.</p>
<br>
	 <h2 style="text-align: center;">Journal (July 12)</h2>
	 <p style="background: #ffffff">
		 What does Manuela Veloso's work have in common with Ayanna Howard's?<br>
		They both work in the field of robotics, creating robots that will assist different types of people. For example, Manuela Veloso is working on "Cobots," which are meant to assist people in performing menial tasks. This is helpful for people who are busy and need assistance. Ayanna Howard's work involves using an arm band that enables those with limited mobility and vocal skills to speak with a certain set of commands.<br><br>
		 How did your team work together on the lightshow, and how can you teamwork improve?<br>
		I think we had trouble properly distributing jobs, but we were able to explain things to each other so that everyone was on the same page. In addition, whenever any of us needed help, we would all stop our own jobs to help solve the problem together. This made for easier problem solving and more efficiency in creating an interesting product.<br><br>
		 What are the basic pieces of every Arduino sketch?<br>
		Most Arduino sketches have a setup at the beginning, to set variables. Within an Arduino there are integers and arrays with different values as well.
<br>
	 <h2 style="text-align:center;">Journal (July 13)</h2>
	 <p style="background: #ffffff">
		 What is something new that you have learned about circuits?<br>
		 I found out that the circuit's power can come from different voltages or digital, but that it must always be connected to ground.<br><br>
		 What was your favorite part of your robot dance?
		 I liked how the ghost code mysteriously followed the music :")<br><br>
		 What kind of outputs do Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard need for their robots?<br>
		 They need outputs for sound, touch, and display, as well as inputs for microphones and touch.
<br>
	 <h2 style="text-align: center;">Escape Bot</h2>
	 <p style="background: #ffffff">
		 <img style="width: 60%;" src="https://cam6688.github.io/Portfolio/escapecode.png";/><br><br>
		 We programmed a robot to "escape" from a "maze." Our group worked together to work through bugs, but difficulties with the bots themselves made things difficult. I also learned to keep track of all the pins to make sure they were in accordance with the code.
<br>
	 <h2 style="text-align:center;">Journal (July 17-18)</h2>
	 <p style="background: #ffffff">
		 What is a list and how is it useful? <br>
		 A list is a set of multiple data points. It is useful for loops when you need to run a lot of data through the same function. It's also helpful to keep multiple pieces of the same data in one place. <br><br>
		 Which groups you worked with worked best together and why?<br>
		 I got to work with Megan and Ankita for a little both yesterday and today. Although we didn't collaborate that much, we were able to answer each other's questions, which was helpful when the teachers/TAs weren't available.<br><br>
		 What is something new you learned about how the internet works?<br>
		 I learned that websites use outsourced servers to let users access their sites.<br><br>
		 Is LaTeX a markup or programming language? How do you know?<br>
		 It's a markup language, because it formats documents. Other markup languages like HTML and XML change the appearance of documents, which is similar to what LaTeX does (format documents).

	 <h2 style="text-align:center;">Journal (July 24)</h2>
	 <p style="background:#ffffff">
	 	How much information about you is available on the internet? Why is it available?<br>
	 	I know that my name, age, and possibly my birthday is available on the internet, due to information being stored online in government and medical records, as well as what I've put online on other sites such as FAcebook.<br><br>
	 	How much can a programmer protect the privacy of their users?<br>
	 	A programmer can encrypt the information that users input, but users must also be aware of cyber security methods and utilize those methods on their own.<br><br>
	 	How do Latanya Sweeney and Shafi Goldwasser protect people's privacy?<br>
	 	They both encrypt information in ways that generalize people's private information so that it's harder for others to hack.
	 <br><br><h2 style="text-align:center;">Final Project Journal</h2>
	 <p style="background:#ffffff">What projects from this summer did you most enjoy working on?
	 	I liked the Python text adventure game, as well as the robotics piezo project.<br><br>
	 	Is there a project from this summer that you'd want to try extending?<br>
	 	I'd expand on the text adventure game, but I have actually done something similar before and I want to challenge myself to do something different this time. I kind of want more time to work with Django, but I had the most trouble with making it work.<br><br>
	 	Is there a new kind of technology you'd like to try to learn more about?<br>
	 	I want to learn how to convert sites into mobile forms to make them more accessible.
	  </p>
<br>
	 <h2 style="text-align:center;">Journal (July 26)</h2><br>
	 <p style="background:#ffffff">
		 Why are Python dicitonaries useful?<br>
		 Python dictionaries assign names to values, meaning that you can use those names to come up with values rather than remembering those values all the time.<br><br>
		 What do you think of the data science field?<br>
		 I am now slightly less afraid of data science. I used to think that it was all super hard math but now I don't think it's nearly as bad as I thought it would be.<br><br>
		 What is most interesting to you about algorithms?<br>
		 I think it's super interesting that algorithms can essentially solve any problem with any numbers. It's also interesting to know that algorithms aren't only used in code, but also in real life.<br><br>
		 How do you think algorithms shape the technology you use every day?<br>
		 Algorithms are probably used for all kinds of data that I put on my phone or computer, etc. They can also be used to send and compute user data to send back to developers.

	 <h2 style="text-align:center;">Journal (July 27)</h2><br>
	 <p style="background:#ffffff">
		 How did using objects make this project easier/harder?<br>
		 Using objects definitely helped organize things easier, but to try coding with them was harder for me to differentiate where I could put different things.<br><br>
		 What is one problem that you are proud of solving, and how did you do it?<br>
		 I didn't know where to put some commands for the user class but I figured it out by thinking about what my end goal would be.
</p>
<br>
	 <h2 style="text-align:center;">Journal (July 28)</h2><br>
	 <p style="background:#ffffff">
		 What are you most proud of figuring out today?<br>
		 I was able to figure out most of my bugs on my own without help, and my program actually worked, lol.<br><br>
		 What are you most excited about for final projects?<br>
		 I'm excited to make an app that is actually helpful towards the environment, and could be used in a widespread manner.
</p>
<br>
	 <h2 style="text-align:center;">Journal (August 1)</h2><br>
	 <p style="background:#ffffff">
		 How is your team dividing up the work? Why did you choose to split it this way?<br>
		 We had 3 main tasks to do, so we split it by who wanted to do what activity.<br><br>
		 What tasks are you responsible for? How are you going to ensure that you complete them?<br>
		 I'm in charge of setting up the UX/UI for the different pages. I'm going to make sure they're completed by setting strict deadlines.
 </p>
 <br>
	 <h2 style="test-align:center;">Journal (August 2)</h2><br>
	 <p style="background: #ffffff">
		What has been the greatest challenge you've faced so far during your final project?<br>
		 I've had the most trouble with the animation and layout for the home page, trying to make the page look professional.<br><br>
		 What skill or trait could you develop to make that challenge easier for you?<br>
		 Being able to read the code from other developers would help me understand what's going on so I could use that code for my own projects.
