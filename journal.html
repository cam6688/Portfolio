		    What are some similarities + differences between Python and Scratch?
		    <br>Python and Scratch are both similar in terms of structure and the order in which you place your code. The commands itself are slightly different. For example Python uses "for" and "while" for loop functions, while Scratch uses "repeat," "while," and "forever." Variable creation is very similar in that Python simply uses the "=" to create a variable, while Scratch has a button to create one. Another difference is that for Python, you need to type out everything, which means you need to know the order in which you put variables and strings after a command. Scratch, in contrast, does this for you.<br>

		    How did debugging feel? What did you like? What was hard for you?<br>
		    Debugging was somewhat hard for me because I found it hard to remember the structure and order that you wrote commands (like if you used the while function I didn't know if I was supposed to put a variable or string afterwards). It wasn't too hard for me other than that because I could check line by line for problems by inactivating one line of code at a time. However, this method got tedious after a while.</p>

		  Today we made an LED light up using resistors, jumper wires, a breadboard and the Board of Education shield. It is our first introduction to robotics using Arduino.

		   How did your idea of robotics change today? What makes you excited/nervous about the future of robotics?<br>
		  I realized today that there are more robots in the world than we think. I think sometimes we forget that robots can be something as simple as the things we use in our daily lives, such as a Roomba. I'm excited to see our usage of robotics expand and become more sophisticated, but at the same time, am worried that these developments will soon create rifts in terms of ethics and safety.<br><br>
		  What worked well, and what could improve with working in groups this week?<br>
		  I liked how the room was centered so that several people could work together instead of just pairs. However, some groups having 5 people while our group only had 3 meant that our workload/problem solving was somewhat hindered. I think it was also somewhat cumbersome to have to make everyone move in order to work on the robot together, since the tables created too much distance. Overall it was a more collaborative experience compared to last week, so I appreciate that.

	We made a series of flashing LED lights today. We timed it to Lady Gaga's Bad Romance. I learned how to use an array to loop different values of a variable, making the lights and the timings flow.</p>

	 <h2 style="text-align: center;">Journal (July 12)</h2>
	 <p style="background: #ffffff">
		 What does Manuela Veloso's work have in common with Ayanna Howard's?<br>
		They both work in the field of robotics, creating robots that will assist different types of people. For example, Manuela Veloso is working on "Cobots," which are meant to assist people in performing menial tasks. This is helpful for people who are busy and need assistance. Ayanna Howard's work involves using an arm band that enables those with limited mobility and vocal skills to speak with a certain set of commands.<br><br>
		 How did your team work together on the lightshow, and how can you teamwork improve?<br>
		I think we had trouble properly distributing jobs, but we were able to explain things to each other so that everyone was on the same page. In addition, whenever any of us needed help, we would all stop our own jobs to help solve the problem together. This made for easier problem solving and more efficiency in creating an interesting product.<br><br>
		 What are the basic pieces of every Arduino sketch?<br>
		Most Arduino sketches have a setup at the beginning, to set variables. Within an Arduino there are integers and arrays with different values as well.

	 <p style="background: #ffffff">
		 What is something new that you have learned about circuits?<br>
		 I found out that the circuit's power can come from different voltages or digital, but that it must always be connected to ground.<br><br>
		 What was your favorite part of your robot dance?
		 I liked how the ghost code mysteriously followed the music :")<br><br>
		 What kind of outputs do Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard need for their robots?<br>
		 They need outputs for sound, touch, and display, as well as inputs for microphones and touch.
<br>
	 <h2 style="text-align: center;">Escape Bot</h2>
	 <p style="background: #ffffff">
		 <img style="width: 60%;" src="https://cam6688.github.io/Portfolio/escapecode.png";/><br><br>
		 We programmed a robot to "escape" from a "maze." Our group worked together to work through bugs, but difficulties with the bots themselves made things difficult. I also learned to keep track of all the pins to make sure they were in accordance with the code.
